# OperatingSystems415

# Summary
 Created by Team Interrobang, this operating system is built using barebones Javascript for users to play around with from their browser. This project utilizes multithreading and multiprocessing through the usage of web workers. Each process and "threads" that are created are initialized as web workers, allowing them to work in a background thread. This allows the user to continue to interact with the UI even when a process is running. Our task scheduler is based on first come first server rather than a more sophisticated task scheduling algortihm such as round robin. The OS serves as a middleman, a layer of abstraction, between the various devices and processes.
