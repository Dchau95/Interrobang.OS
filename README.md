# OperatingSystems415
BIG NOTE: For multithreading purposes, we used web workers. According to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21408510/chrome-cant-load-web-worker if you try to load the scripts from a local file, it will fail. We used Brackets text editor to get around this. Use Firefox, not Chrome. Or better yet, use the link provided above: dchau95.github.io/OperatingSystems415/
# Summary
 Created by Team [], we created this operating system in Javascript, [], for users to play around in their own little OS straight from their browser. This project also helped us grow our skills in learning how an operating system works, such as how multithreading and multiprocessing works, as well as learning what deadlocks are and how to deal with them. We learned how the OS serves as a middleman between the various devices and the processes and many more things that happened under the hood. Not only that, but our skills in Javascript grew as well as we had to learn how to develop this OS in pure javascript and dealing with multiple processes running in a single threaded environment.
