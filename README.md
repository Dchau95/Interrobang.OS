# OperatingSystems415
BIG NOTE: For multithreading purposes, we used web workers. According to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21408510/chrome-cant-load-web-worker if you try to load the scripts from a local file, it will fail. We used Brackets text editor to get around this.

# Summary
 Created by Team Interrobang, this operating system is built using barebones Javascript for users to play around with from their browser. This project has improved our understanding of how an operating system works. We have learned how multithreading and multiprocessing works as well as what deadlocks are and how to deal with them. We learned how the OS serves as a middleman between the various devices and processes and many more things that happens under the hood. Not only that, but our skills in Javascript grew as well as we had to learn how to develop this OS in pure javascript and dealing with multiple processes running in a single threaded environment.
